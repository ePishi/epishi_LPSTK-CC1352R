 *
 *  @brief      Dual Mode Manager Scheduler
 *  
 *  DMM enables devices to run multiple wireless protocol stacks concurrently. 
 *  The DMMSch is to enable concurrent operation of multiple stacks with minimized conflicts 
 *  so that it does not cause significant performance degradation.  
 *  The DMMSch uses Application Level, Stack Level information, and Global Priority Table (GPT) when scheduling a command. 
 *  Stack Level information (provided by stack) is embedded in each RF command and it includes:
 *  - Start Type, Start Time, AllowDelay, Priority, Activity, etc.  
 *  Application Level information (provided by User via the Policy Table) includes:
 *  - Application State Name, Weight, AppliedActivity, Pause, etc.   
 *  Global Priority Table (GPT)
 *  - GPT defines relative priorities of the two stacks
 *  The DMMSch uses Start Type, Start Time, and AllowDelay (Stack Level Information) when scheduling a RF command
 *  and tries to avoid a conflict by delaying the command if allowed. 
 *  When a command conflicts with another (during scheduling or execution), 
 *  The DMMSch selects one command over the other based on the final priority of two commands as below:
 *  Final Priority = GPT (Stack level priority) +  weight (Application Level) 
 * 
 *  # DMMSch API #
 *
 *  To use the DMMSch module to schedule a tacks RF commands, the application
 *  calls the following APIs:
 *    - DMMSch_init(): Initialize the DMMSch module/task.
 *    - DMMSch_Params_init():  Initialize a DMMSch_Params structure
 *      with default values.  Then change the parameters from non-default
 *      values as needed.
 *    - DMMSch_open():  Open an instance of the DMMSch module,
 *      passing the initialized parameters.
 *    - Stack A application - DMMSch_registerClient: Passes Task_Handle and StackRole so 
 * 							  DMMSch can map the Task_Handle to the stack role 
 *    - Stack A application - Rf_open -> DMMSch_rfOpen: DMMSch overwrites the RF_Mode and 
 *                            rf patches for multi-mode operation, maps RF Handle to the stack ID,
 *                            assigns phySwitchingTime for DMM operation. 
 *                            From this point, Task_Handle, StackRole, and Stack ID are all related. 
 *    - Stack B application - DMMSch_registerClient: Passes Task_Handle and StackRole so 
 * 							  DMMSch can map the Task_Handle to the stack role 
 *    - Stack B application - Rf_open -> DMMSch_rfOpen: Rf_open -> DMMSch_rfOpen: DMMSch overwrites the RF_Mode and 
 *                            rf patches for multi-mode operation, maps RF Handle to the stack ID,
 *                            assigns phySwitchingTime for DMM operation. 
 *                            From this point, Task_Handle, StackRole, and Stack ID are all related. 
 *    - Stack A application - RF_scheduleCmd -> DMMSch_rfScheduleCmd: DMMSch adjusted timing based on policy
 *    - Stack B application - RF_scheduleCmd -> DMMSch_rfScheduleCmd: DMMSch adjusted timing based on policy
